# GettingAndCleaningData-Project
The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set in order to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

# The R scrpit called run_analysis.R was created to do the following 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set;
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set;
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names;
5. Create and export a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Code Book
This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in tidydata.txt.
